I designed this component last. So, the result was an artifact of other decisions. In particular, I had already designed the bottom plate with a hex plug. I wanted the lanterns to be well supported so they wouldn't start leaning over, so I opted 1/2" rebar in a small amount of cement.  This was covered by a painted section of 3/4" 

This piece and the finial I filled by spraying the filler.
