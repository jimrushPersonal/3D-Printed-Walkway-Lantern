The roof is a fairly simple design and is mostly an artifact of the body and the tower. Given that the tower and finial are glued together and then to the top, which could form a seal, I added a small hole for air or anything else that might get insight.

The underneath, inside of the lantern, is painted a bright white to reflect and defuse the LED lighting.

**Areas for improvement**
- Similar to the base, the grooves for the body and tower should have been larger. Given this is a glued joint, it would have helped with lining up the parts and I think improve adhesion. Note, that would have meant a thicker component, but I don't see that as a concern.
- While Fusion makes it easy to use the same sketch for the groove cuts, at the corners I would have preferred no guide or something with significantly larger tolerances.
