# Tower and Finial

The tower and finial are both designed from swept splines. In general, I'm fairly happy with the results. 

The finial was sprayed with an antique bronze spray paint, which gave it a nice highlight on the lamp.

The finial is glued to the tower, which in turn is glued to the top.

**Areas for improvement**
- I had several issues with Fusion 360 around the tower. Mostly driven by my Fusion 360 experience. Several times I ended up with parts that were no longer tied to the their constraints as I tried different approaches.
- Similar to other parts in this project the part mating grooves needed to be much deeper and with larger tolerances. The current solution work, but took more effort to get glued correctly.
