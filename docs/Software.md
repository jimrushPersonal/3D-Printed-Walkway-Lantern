WLED is sufficient to drive the LEDs, but I really want animations that were aware of the lantern structure. For example, blinking runway style lights that could fly towards or away from the house. I also wanted to see if I could get a lantern flicker that I liked. There are only 12 LEDs, so that may be difficult.

The software is still in progress and will be tightly couple with my existing home automation software that is mostly home grown (e.g. Not Home Assistant or any other standard package). But, the animation logic should be reasonably decoupled. Once I can get it working, I might post the code. Anybody that uses it will need do some significant development to incorporate it in their own project.
