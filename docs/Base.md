This is the base portion of the lantern. It was designed after building the main body. It has grooves to fit the body and attaches via screws.

**Areas for improvement**
- I should have made deeper grooves and maybe a slightly larger tollerance in the groove. this was a general problem with grooves. For the base, it was less of an issue as the screws locked the main body in place.
