This is the base portion of the lantern. It was designed after building the main body. It has grooves to fit the body and attaches via screws.

Note, the top portion of this component (inside of lantern), is painted bright white to help reflect and diffuse the LED lighting.

**Areas for improvement**
- I should have made deeper grooves and maybe a slightly larger tollerance in the groove. this was a general problem with grooves. For the base, it was less of an issue as the screws locked the main body in place.
