I'm reasonably happy with the light stem. I needed the LEDs to be high and low enough that they weren't that visible through the mylar, but far enough from the top and bottom to get a good spread of light. The current size is a reasonable compromise.  Anything better on that point would probably require significant design change.

The LED holes are sized close enough to the NEO Pixel size that just putting the LEDs into the hole with some force and using friction to keep them in place has worked well. Additionally, I've already had one LED fail on me and getting access to the LED to cut it out and replace it, worked reasonably well.

The base of the step has a hole for wiring to go down to the base.

The [NEO Pixel LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AG923GI) come in runs of 50. I cut them into runs of 6. The soldered the wires and sealed with [heat shrink tubing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B38PGS1Y/).

**Areas for improvement**
- The link between the step and the top light holder is too weak. I broke one or two during assembly. Instead of the top feeding into the stop, it should have wrapped over it.
- The hole was just large enough. I think, a bigger hole would have been better as it would have allowed me to pull the wire joints into that space.
