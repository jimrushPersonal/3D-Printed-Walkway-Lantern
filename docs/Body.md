The body was the most complicated component and the one I am the most disappointed with. I would have liked to have allocated more time to it, but I put some limits on how much time I would spend and how many iterations.  Print time was significant, so it was difficult to include many of the lessons learned.

The body have several design iterations. My original plan was to support removable plastic covers in front of the mylar panels to allow for holiday themed shadow images.  I eventually discounted this while trying to get it to work and design images that I thought would look good at this scale. And, I realized it significantly grew the build.

Through experimentation, I decided two sheets of the mylar I purchased provided the best diffusion. I would still like more, but a third didn't improve it and started to detract from the lighting.

The mylar slides into slots on each side of the opening.  The bottom of the body has spots to embed [four nurled insert nuts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G9NL291/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and connected to the base plate with [four m4 screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GH8LSGZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1).

The body is glued to the top piece.  Both the Base and Top have groves to accept the body.

**Areas for improvement**
- In general, I think I might have been better off designing 6 sides that then attached to each other. Maybe with some type of pinned structure that then could be glued. It would have accelerated the prototyping significant, letting me address most of the problems below.
- I never found an upper bridge support I liked, so I ended not using one and just cleaning the print up
- The walls should have been thicker and support to prevent them from splaying. As the upper bridge reconnects posts, some shifting occurs. This caused the mylar slots to get bent. I had to force a putty knife down the slots to open and better align them. It isn't visible from the outside, but impacted the build.
- The top should have also been attached with screws. If the body or above is damaged, all pieces need to be reprinted. Additionally, it would have made it easier to replace the mylar sheets as the support for the insert nuts prevent the sheets from just being slid up when separated from the base.
- The post should have been thickened. Not so much for strength, but to provide better tolerances for the slots.
