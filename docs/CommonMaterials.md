## 3D Printing

I used a Prusa MK3+ printer for all printing along with the standard Prusa Slicer. There are some minor customizations in my print settings, but I don't think any of them are too important and were determined by this project.  Based on the slicer information, you could almost get 3 lanterns from a 1 Kg roll of filament. I had various printer failures, prototypes, ect. so I'm sure I used more.
