## Project Introduction

This project was designed to accomplish two goals. First, I wanted to learn how to build more complicated things in Fusion 360.  Second, I wanted some cool, smart walkway lights for my house. This project contains the result of that exercise.

The walkway lights are roughly 12 inches tall, not counting the support stem. They are designed to be mounted on 3/4" PVC pipe.  Inside of each light is 12 outdoor Neopixel LEDs arranged with 6 towards the top and 6 towards the bottom. The controller is a ESP32 with a standard WLED image. I printed them in PETG, and will find out how they handle the Arizona summer in a few months.

### Disclaimer

This project was designed for me.  Not to be a solution for anybody out there with a 3D printer.  It is far from perfect and I don't consider this a ready to go project for anybody that wants to pick it up.  It might work for you, it might not. And, it hasn't been road tested outside of my own development environment.  You've been warned. 

### What is included

- Materials I used and links to anything I bought online (not affiliate links)
- Fusion 360 project
- STEP files exported from Fusion 360
- Prusa 3D generated .3mf files
- Some build progress pictures
- Commentary about each of the components

To avoid having a wall of text, I've broken this documentation into numerous parts to make it easier to digest. I listed the components from the bottom to the top.
